# 🏆 Timed Challenges

## Purpose
This folder contains your **timed coding challenges** - assessments taken every 3 problems to measure your progress and adjust your learning plan.

---

## How It Works

### Timing
- **Every 3 problems**: After completing 3 practice problems, you'll take a timed challenge
- **Random language**: I'll randomly select one of your 5 languages
- **Time limits**: 30-60 minutes depending on difficulty
- **Real interview conditions**: Simulates actual technical interviews

### Schedule
```
Day 4: Challenge #1 (After Days 1-3)
Day 8: Challenge #2 (After Days 5-7)
Day 12: Challenge #3 (After Days 9-11)
```

## What Gets Stored Here

When you complete a timed challenge, you'll save:
- `challenge-1-[date].py` (or .js, .cs, .go, .ts)
- `challenge-1-notes.md` - Your approach, struggles, learnings
- `challenge-1-results.txt` - Time taken, test results

```

## Assessment Criteria

After each challenge, we'll evaluate:
1. ✅ **Correctness** - Does it work?
2. ⏱️ **Speed** - How long did it take?
3. 🧠 **Approach** - Did you identify the right pattern?
4. 💬 **Communication** - Did you explain your thinking?
5. 🐛 **Debugging** - How did you handle errors?

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Set a timer** - Stick to the time limit
2. **Think out loud** - Practice explaining as you code
3. **Write tests first** - Plan before coding
4. **Don't give up** - If stuck, explain what you'd do with more time
5. **Reflect after** - Write down what you learned

**Your first challenge will be created after you complete Day 3!**

Until then, focus on understanding the patterns in your practice problems.
