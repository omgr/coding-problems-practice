## 🎯 Your First Step

### Option 1: Jump Right In (Recommended)
```powershell
cd problems\01-arrays-and-hashing\001-two-sum
code .
```

Open `README.md` to read the problem, then open `solution.py` to start coding!

### Option 2: Read First
```powershell
code GETTING-STARTED.md
```

This guides you through the coaching approach for your first problem.

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### Before Each Problem
1. Read README.md thoroughly
2. Understand the pattern
3. Think about your approach
4. Explain it to yourself

### While Solving
1. Start with Python or C# (your primary)
2. Write comments explaining your logic
3. Test thoroughly
4. Port to other languages

### After Solving
1. Verify all tests pass
2. Analyze time/space complexity
3. Update progress tracker
4. Reflect on what you learned

## 🎯 Recommended First Actions

### Action 1: Read the Getting Started Guide (10 min)
```powershell
code docs\GETTING-STARTED.md
```

### Action 2: Start Two Sum (1 hour)
```powershell
cd problems\01-arrays-and-hashing\001-two-sum
code README.md
code solution.py
```

### Action 3: Track Your Progress
```powershell
code docs\progress-tracker.md
```
Mark ✅ when you complete each problem in each language.

## 💡 Key Points

### 1. This is a Journey
- 14 days of consistent practice
- 4 hours per day (2 morning + 2 evening)
- Focus on understanding, not just solving

### 2. Multi-Language Learning
- Implement every problem in all 5 languages
- Python and C# are your primary focus
- JS, TS, Go help you learn syntax and paradigms

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- Each problem teaches a pattern
- Recognize patterns in new problems
- Build intuition for which pattern to use

### 4. Self-Assessment
- Every 3 problems, you'll take a timed challenge
- I'll adjust difficulty based on your performance
- Track your progress in progress-tracker.md
