# 🎯 14-Day Coding Interview Mastery Plan

## Overview
**Goal**: Master the most important coding patterns and algorithms for technical interviews  
**Timeline**: 14 days (2 weeks)  
**Daily Commitment**: 4 hours (2 hours morning + 2 hours evening)  
**Problems per Day**: 3 practice problems + 1 timed challenge (every 4th day)  
**Languages**: Python (primary), C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go  
**Based on**: Grind 75 (optimized LeetCode problem set)

## Strategy
- **Days 1-3**: Learn 3 problems, implement in all 5 languages
- **Day 4**: Timed challenge based on Days 1-3 concepts (random language)
- Repeat pattern throughout 14 days
- Focus on pattern recognition over memorization
- Build muscle memory through multi-language implementation

## Learning Approach
1. **Before Coding**: Explain the concept in your own words
2. **During Coding**: Draft explanations in comments for future reference
3. **After 3 Problems**: Timed assessment to measure progress
4. **Continuous**: Adjust difficulty based on performance
